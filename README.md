# Leetcode Selected

## Motivation
After practicing on leetcode.com for a while, I realized that simply trying to solve random problems could not give me enough improvements. So I decided to start this new project to help me learn in a more efficient way.

## Description 
In this project, I will select excellent problems from leetcode and group them by tags (or categories, algorithm paradigms, etc.), to analyse the similarities and difference among them.

I will use Python 3 and notebook format in this repository, since it is the language that I have been using most frequently recently and notebook is a great tool to combine codes and texts (markdown).

## Waiting list
