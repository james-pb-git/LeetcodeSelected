    "# Breadth-first search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breadth-first search** is a common search algorithm used for tree or graph structures. Using this method, we actually visit elements \"layer by layer\", i.e. visit one elment, then its neighbors, and then neighbors of neighbors. As a result, one of the most frequent ways to use it is to solve \"shortest path\" questions, where the optimal solution is actually the layer with smallest index.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement, we might need to use three different types of data structures:\n",
    "- **Queue**: to store all the nodes to visit\n",
    "- **HashSet**: if we are traversing a graph, we will need to remember visited nodes.\n",
    "- **Tree**: if we are required to output the shortest path we found. In this tree, we store the parent of each node."

    "We usually need to record the \"layer index\" while BFSing, and this index is the current distance in a \"shortest path\" type of problem, or the current depth in a max depth question like this one. To do this, basically, there are three approaches:\n",
    "1. Add a layer attribute to the node element, so each element in the queue will be like {'val': 3, 'layer': 2}\n",
    "2. Implemnt two queues: current and next. On each level, we append neighbors (children) to the queue \"next\", and when the queue \"current\" is empty, we simply swap \"current\" and \"next\", and layer += 1\n",
    "3. **Before visiting each level, we count the length of current queue, and use a for loop to process all current nodes. At the end of the for loop, we add 1 to the layer variable, and start next level.**\n",
    "I think this third one is best, because it's simplest to implement and most readable. As you can see, I adopted this method in the problem.\n",
